Procedural Generation of Cities 
===============================

This project generates cities procedurally based on user supplied parameters, it allows for the generation of terrain, road systems and buildings all with a focus on the user control over these generations. 

This project is a continuation of my dissertation and the aim of current development is to provide UI for generation and optimization and extension of features (buildings in particular).

Included in this repository is the write up created alongside the generator which details development and stratagies used. It also includes references to other related works 

===============================

This repository contains builds for those interested in trying the generator without needing to install unity, please note that as of 15/12/2024 the build does not provide the full functionality of the generator as found in the unity editor as this is in active development.

This Project was created in Unity version 2022.3.14f1
